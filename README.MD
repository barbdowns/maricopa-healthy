Feature Branching: [@FeatureBranching](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)

Feature Tracking: All development should be tracked via a centralized planning board, most likely, GloBoards. Features will be tracked via individual cards.
In order to preserve a sense of organization each card will correspond to a specific ticket number. Ticket numbers will consist of 3 components: developer initials,
Current version release as it corresponds to Sprint number, and the current time formatted as `initials-VersionRelease-HHMM`.

An example of a valid ticket number would consist of: `OS-0.0.1-0732`.
