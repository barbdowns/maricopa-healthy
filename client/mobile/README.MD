# Maricopa Healthy Mobile Platform

## Proposal
#### Project Description
Maricopa Healthy is an existing mobile app that was originally launched in March 2016. It was built on a proprietary template, has very limited functionality and several unresolved bugs have decreased user retention and limit the product ownerâ€™s ability to promote the app. The goal of the app rebuild is to:
- Fix the existings bugs;
- Increase and improve app functionality;
- Promote user engagement; and
- Allow the app and its content to be easily shared and promoted by both users and the product owner. 

- From a technical perspective, the new Maricopa Healthy app must be:
- Built for iOS and Android platforms using an open-source framework;
- Compatible with mobile phones and tablets;
- Able to support previous versions of both platforms; and
- Capable of sharing individual database records as HTML content in a web view.

The following sections detail the features and related functionality of the mobile application rebuild:
